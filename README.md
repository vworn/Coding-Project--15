Coding Challenge: Risk Management Dashboard
Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you'll develop an interactive Risk Management Dashboard that helps businesses assess and manage various risks. You'll use DOM manipulation to dynamically add, update, and remove risk assessments. This challenge reinforces selecting nodes, using createElement, appendChild, removeChild, and handling event propagation with stopPropagation().

The business case simulates a real-world scenario where a company needs to efficiently track risks across different departments.
